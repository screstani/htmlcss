            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> I'm from Curitiba, a beautiful city in Brazil, but currently, I'm living in the eternal city of Rome, Italy. It's an incredible place to be! <br>
            <br>
            I have a diverse background in History and Public Administration, which has given me a unique perspective on the world. <br>
            <br>
            However, after working in the Brazilian public administration for several years, I realized that I was looking for a new challenge. 
            That's when I decided to make a career transition and become a full-stack developer. It's been two years since then, and I have to say, I'm really enjoying it! I love the creative problem-solving that comes with being a developer, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills.
